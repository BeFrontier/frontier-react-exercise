# Hi
I am Laura, Frontend developer originally from Italy who recently relocated to The Netherlands.
IT college graduate, self-taught web developer, I've been moving on the stack quite a while, finding my balance as full-stack JS developer.
Sports lover, travel junkie (...well when we sill could travel), practising a strict 0 inbox policy and with a severe case of British humour.
Never got a Google reCAPTCHA right at the first try.

Mark introduced me to Frontiers, I had great fun working on this.

# On the assignment
Few notes before you dive into the code:
## Features
- dynamic creation of the forms from json
- console log of forms on Submit
- unit test of Section and TextElement component
- really basic responsive styling

## Time spent
1 day

## Thoughts
I believe this assignment it's intentionally left broad. I set as maximum time for this assignment 1 day, therefore I've decided to focus on the behavioural aspect more than on the look.

# Getting started
- Install packages: `npm install`
- Start development server: `npm start`
- Run unit test suit: `npm test`


Looking forward to your feedback,
Thanks!

â€“ Laura
